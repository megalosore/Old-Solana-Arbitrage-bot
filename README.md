Solana Arbitrage Bot

Welcome to the Solana Arbitrage Bot repository! This project, initiated in 2021, aimed to deepen understanding of Golang and explore the evolving Solana blockchain ecosystem. The primary objective was to develop a bot capable of identifying and exploiting arbitrage opportunities within the Solana network.

Arbitrage Techniques

The bot is engineered to capitalize on price discrepancies between various decentralized exchanges (DEX) within the Solana blockchain. It employs two main arbitrage strategies:

    Circular Arbitrage (4_orca and cyclic): This strategy involves exploiting circular arbitrage opportunities on the Orca DEX. For example, converting USDC to SOL, then SOL to ETH, and finally ETH back to USDC, aiming to profit from price differentials.

    DEX-to-DEX Arbitrage (DexToDex): This strategy focuses on arbitrage opportunities between two DEX platforms handling the same pair of currencies. For instance, taking advantage of price disparities between Raydium and Orca for the USDC to SOL trading pair.

Project Status

Given the rapid evolution of the Solana blockchain since 2021, this codebase is outdated.
