Solana Arbitrage Bot

Welcome to the Solana Arbitrage Bot repository! This project was initiated in 2021 as a solo endeavor to delve deeper into Golang and explore the Solana blockchain ecosystem. The primary objective of this project is to develop a bot capable of identifying and capitalizing on arbitrage opportunities within the Solana ecosystem.
Features

    Arbitrage Techniques: The bot is designed to leverage discrepancies in prices between different decentralized exchanges (DEX) within the Solana blockchain.

    Profit Generation: By swiftly executing trades based on price differentials, the bot aims to generate profit for the user.
Because this code was written in 2021, the blockchain Solana greatly evolved from what it was and it is very likely that this code needs to be rewritten from scratch.
